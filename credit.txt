To get credit for the programming thread:

* Do the hw6 problems I gave you in hw6-ours.html and commit them in hw6.py
* Send these hw6-ours.html questions to Alejandro (whose email address you should already have)
* Commit romeo-and-juliet.pdf from your home computer, which you generated from your hw8 solution.
* Write and submit your self-eval and faculty evals for me, Sherri, and Neal online at my.evergreen.edu

Please do this by 5pm tomorrow (Friday).

Thanks,
Paul
